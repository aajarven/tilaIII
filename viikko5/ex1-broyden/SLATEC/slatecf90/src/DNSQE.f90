!***DESCRIPTION
!
! 1. Purpose.
!
!       The purpose of DNSQE is to find a zero of a system of N
!       nonlinear functions in N variables by a modification of the
!       Powell hybrid method.  This is done by using the more general
!       nonlinear equation solver DNSQ.  The user must provide a
!       subroutine which calculates the functions.  The user has the
!       option of either to provide a subroutine which calculates the
!       Jacobian or to let the code calculate it by a forward-difference
!       approximation.  This code is the combination of the MINPACK
!       codes (Argonne) HYBRD1 and HYBRJ1.
!
! 2. Subroutine and Type Statements.
!
!       SUBROUTINE DNSQE(FCN,JAC,IOPT,N,X,FVEC,TOL,NPRINT,INFO,
!      *                  WA,LWA)
!       INTEGER IOPT,N,NPRINT,INFO,LWA
!       DOUBLE PRECISION TOL
!       DOUBLE PRECISION X(N),FVEC(N),WA(LWA)
!       EXTERNAL FCN,JAC
!
! 3. Parameters.
!
!       Parameters designated as input parameters must be specified on
!       entry to DNSQE and are not changed on exit, while parameters
!       designated as output parameters need not be specified on entry
!       and are set to appropriate values on exit from DNSQE.
!
!       FCN is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which calculates
!         the functions.  FCN must be declared in an external statement
!         in the user calling program, and should be written as follows.
!
!         SUBROUTINE FCN(N,X,FVEC,IFLAG)
!         INTEGER N,IFLAG
!         DOUBLE PRECISION X(N),FVEC(N)
!         ----------
!         Calculate the functions at X and
!         return this vector in FVEC.
!         ----------
!         return
!         END
!
!         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by FCN unless the
!         user wants to terminate execution of DNSQE.  In this case set
!         IFLAG to a negative integer.
!
!       JAC is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which calculates
!         the Jacobian.  If IOPT=1, then JAC must be declared in an
!         external statement in the user calling program, and should be
!         written as follows.
!
!         SUBROUTINE JAC(N,X,FVEC,FJAC,LDFJAC,IFLAG)
!         INTEGER N,LDFJAC,IFLAG
!         DOUBLE PRECISION X(N),FVEC(N),FJAC(LDFJAC,N)
!         ----------
!         Calculate the Jacobian at X and return this
!         matrix in FJAC.  FVEC contains the function
!         values at X and should not be altered.
!         ----------
!         return
!         END
!
!         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by JAC unless the
!         user wants to terminate execution of DNSQE. In this case set
!         IFLAG to a negative integer.
!
!         If IOPT=2, JAC can be ignored (treat it as a dummy argument).
!
!       IOPT is an input variable which specifies how the Jacobian will
!         be calculated.  If IOPT=1, then the user must supply the
!         Jacobian through the subroutine JAC.  If IOPT=2, then the
!         code will approximate the Jacobian by forward-differencing.
!
!       N is a positive integer input variable set to the number of
!         functions and variables.
!
!       X is an array of length N.  On input X must contain an initial
!         estimate of the solution vector.  On output X contains the
!         final estimate of the solution vector.
!
!       FVEC is an output array of length N which contains the functions
!         evaluated at the output X.
!
!       TOL is a nonnegative input variable.  Termination occurs when
!         the algorithm estimates that the relative error between X and
!         the solution is at most TOL.  Section 4 contains more details
!         about TOL.
!
!       NPRINT is an integer input variable that enables controlled
!         printing of iterates if it is positive.  In this case, FCN is
!         called with IFLAG = 0 at the beginning of the first iteration
!         and every NPRINT iterations thereafter and immediately prior
!         to return, with X and FVEC available for printing. Appropriate
!         print statements must be added to FCN(see example).  If NPRINT
!         is not positive, no special calls of FCN with IFLAG = 0 are
!         made.
!
!       INFO is an integer output variable.  If the user has terminated
!         execution, INFO is set to the (negative) value of IFLAG.  See
!         description of FCN and JAC. Otherwise, INFO is set as follows.
!
!         INFO = 0  Improper input parameters.
!
!         INFO = 1  Algorithm estimates that the relative error between
!                   X and the solution is at most TOL.
!
!         INFO = 2  Number of calls to FCN has reached or exceeded
!                   100*(N+1) for IOPT=1 or 200*(N+1) for IOPT=2.
!
!         INFO = 3  TOL is too small.  No further improvement in the
!                   approximate solution X is possible.
!
!         INFO = 4  Iteration is not making good progress.
!
!         Sections 4 and 5 contain more details about INFO.
!
!       WA is a work array of length LWA.
!
!       LWA is a positive integer input variable not less than
!         (3*N**2+13*N))/2.
!
! 4. Successful Completion.
!
!       The accuracy of DNSQE is controlled by the convergence parameter
!       TOL.  This parameter is used in a test which makes a comparison
!       between the approximation X and a solution XSOL.  DNSQE
!       terminates when the test is satisfied.  If TOL is less than the
!       machine precision (as defined by the  function D1MACH(4)), then
!       DNSQE only attempts to satisfy the test defined by the machine
!       precision.  Further progress is not usually possible.  Unless
!       high precision solutions are required, the recommended value
!       for TOL is the square root of the machine precision.
!
!       The test assumes that the functions are reasonably well behaved,
!       and, if the Jacobian is supplied by the user, that the functions
!       and the Jacobian are coded consistently. If these conditions are
!       not satisfied, then DNSQE may incorrectly indicate convergence.
!       The coding of the Jacobian can be checked by the subroutine
!       DCKDER.  If the Jacobian is coded correctly or IOPT=2, then
!       the validity of the answer can be checked, for example, by
!       rerunning DNSQE with a tighter tolerance.
!
!       Convergence Test.  If DENORM(Z) denotes the Euclidean norm of a
!         vector Z, then this test attempts to guarantee that
!
!               DENORM(X-XSOL)  <=  TOL*DENORM(XSOL).
!
!         If this condition is satisfied with TOL = 10**(-K), then the
!         larger components of X have K significant decimal digits and
!         INFO is set to 1.  There is a danger that the smaller
!         components of X may have large relative errors, but the fast
!         rate of convergence of DNSQE usually avoids this possibility.
!
! 5. Unsuccessful Completion.
!
!       Unsuccessful termination of DNSQE can be due to improper input
!       parameters, arithmetic interrupts, an excessive number of
!       function evaluations, errors in the functions, or lack of good
!       progress.
!
!       Improper Input Parameters.  INFO is set to 0 if IOPT  <  1, or
!         IOPT  >  2, or N  <=  0, or TOL  <  0.E0, or
!         LWA  <  (3*N**2+13*N)/2.
!
!       Arithmetic Interrupts.  If these interrupts occur in the FCN
!         subroutine during an early stage of the computation, they may
!         be caused by an unacceptable choice of X by DNSQE.  In this
!         case, it may be possible to remedy the situation by not
!         evaluating the functions here, but instead setting the
!         components of FVEC to numbers that exceed those in the initial
!         FVEC.
!
!       Excessive Number of Function Evaluations.  If the number of
!         calls to FCN reaches 100*(N+1) for IOPT=1 or 200*(N+1) for
!         IOPT=2, then this indicates that the routine is converging
!         very slowly as measured by the progress of FVEC, and INFO is
!         set to 2.  This situation should be unusual because, as
!         indicated below, lack of good progress is usually diagnosed
!         earlier by DNSQE, causing termination with INFO = 4.
!
!       Errors In the Functions.  When IOPT=2, the choice of step length
!         in the forward-difference approximation to the Jacobian
!         assumes that the relative errors in the functions are of the
!         order of the machine precision.  If this is not the case,
!         DNSQE may fail (usually with INFO = 4).  The user should
!         then either use DNSQ and set the step length or use IOPT=1
!         and supply the Jacobian.
!
!       Lack of Good Progress.  DNSQE searches for a zero of the system
!         by minimizing the sum of the squares of the functions.  In so
!         doing, it can become trapped in a region where the minimum
!         does not correspond to a zero of the system and, in this
!         situation, the iteration eventually fails to make good
!         progress.  In particular, this will happen if the system does
!         not have a zero.  If the system has a zero, rerunning DNSQE
!         from a different starting point may be helpful.
!
! 6. Characteristics of The Algorithm.
!
!       DNSQE is a modification of the Powell Hybrid method.  Two of
!       its main characteristics involve the choice of the correction as
!       a convex combination of the Newton and scaled gradient
!       directions, and the updating of the Jacobian by the rank-1
!       method of Broyden.  The choice of the correction guarantees
!       (under reasonable conditions) global convergence for starting
!       points far from the solution and a fast rate of convergence.
!       The Jacobian is calculated at the starting point by either the
!       user-supplied subroutine or a forward-difference approximation,
!       but it is not recalculated until the rank-1 method fails to
!       produce satisfactory progress.
!
!       Timing.  The time required by DNSQE to solve a given problem
!         depends on N, the behavior of the functions, the accuracy
!         requested, and the starting point.  The number of arithmetic
!         operations needed by DNSQE is about 11.5*(N**2) to process
!         each evaluation of the functions (call to FCN) and 1.3*(N**3)
!         to process each evaluation of the Jacobian (call to JAC,
!         if IOPT = 1).  Unless FCN and JAC can be evaluated quickly,
!         the timing of DNSQE will be strongly influenced by the time
!         spent in FCN and JAC.
!
!       Storage.  DNSQE requires (3*N**2 + 17*N)/2 single precision
!         storage locations, in addition to the storage required by the
!         program.  There are no internally declared storage arrays.
