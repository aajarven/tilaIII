!
! Purpose                SEPX4 solves for either the second-order
!                        finite difference approximation or a
!                        fourth-order approximation  to the
!                        solution of a separable elliptic equation

!                          If IORDER=2, the user may equivalence GRHS
!                          and USOL to save space.  Note that in this
!                          case the tables specifying the boundaries of
!                          the GRHS and USOL arrays determine the
!                          boundaries uniquely except at the corners.
!                          If the tables call for both G(X,Y) and
!                          U(X,Y) at a corner then the solution must be
!                          chosen.  For example, if MBDCND=2 and
!                          NBDCND=4, then U(A,C), U(A,D), U(B,D) must be
!                          chosen at the corners in addition to G(B,C).
!
!                          If IORDER=4, then the two arrays, USOL and
!                          GRHS, must be distinct.
!
!                          USOL should be dimensioned IDMN by at least
!                          N+1 in the calling routine.
!
!                        IDMN
!                          The row (or first) dimension of the arrays
!                          GRHS and USOL as it appears in the program
!                          calling SEPX4.  This parameter is used to
!                          specify the variable dimension of GRHS and
!                          USOL.  IDMN must be at least 7 and greater
!                          than or equal to M+1.
!
!                        W
!                          A one-dimensional array that must be provided
!                          by the user for work space.
!                          10*N+(16+INT(log2(N)))*(M+1)+23 will suffice
!                          as a length for W.  The actual length of
!                          W in the calling routine must be set in W(1)
!                          (see IERROR=11).
!
! On Output              USOL
!                          Contains the approximate solution to the
!                          elliptic equation.  USOL(I,J) is the
!                          approximation to U(XI,YJ) for I=1,2...,M+1
!                          and J=1,2,...,N+1.  The approximation has
!                          error O(DLX**2+DLY**2) if called with
!                          IORDER=2 and O(DLX**4+DLY**4) if called with
!                          IORDER=4.
!
!                        W
!                          W(1) contains the exact minimal length (in
!                          floating point) required for the work space
!                          (see IERROR=11).
!
!                        PERTRB
!                          If a combination of periodic or derivative
!                          boundary conditions (i.e., ALPHA=BETA=0 if
!                          MBDCND=3) is specified and if CF(X)=0 for all
!                          X, then a solution to the discretized matrix
!                          equation may not exist (reflecting the non-
!                          uniqueness of solutions to the PDE).  PERTRB
!                          is a constant calculated and subtracted from
!                          the right hand side of the matrix equation
!                          insuring the existence of a solution.
!                          SEPX4 computes this solution which is a
!                          weighted minimal least squares solution to
!                          the original problem.  If singularity is
!                          not detected PERTRB=0.0 is returned by
!                          SEPX4.

! History                SEPX4 was developed by modifying the ULIB
!                        routine SEPELI during October 1978.
!                        It should be used instead of SEPELI whenever
!                        possible.  The increase in speed is at least
!                        a factor of three.
!
! Algorithm              SEPX4 automatically discretizes the separable
!                        elliptic equation which is then solved by a
!                        generalized cyclic reduction algorithm in the
!                        subroutine POIS.  The fourth order solution
!                        is obtained using the technique of
!                        deferred corrections referenced below.
