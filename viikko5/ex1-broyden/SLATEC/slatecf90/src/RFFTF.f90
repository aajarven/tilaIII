!
!   Subroutine RFFTF computes the Fourier coefficients of a real
!   periodic sequence (Fourier analysis).  The transform is defined
!   below at output parameter R.
!
!   Input Arguments
!
!   N       the length of the array R to be transformed.  The method
!           is most efficient when N is a product of small primes.
!           N may change so long as different work arrays are provided.
!
!   R       a real array of length N which contains the sequence
!           to be transformed.
!
!   WSAVE   a work array which must be dimensioned at least 2*N+15
!           in the program that calls RFFTF.  The WSAVE array must be
!           initialized by calling subroutine RFFTI, and a different
!           WSAVE array must be used for each different value of N.
!           This initialization does not have to be repeated so long as
!           remains unchanged.  Thus subsequent transforms can be
!           obtained faster than the first.  Moreover, the same WSAVE
!           array can be used by RFFTF and RFFTB as long as N remains
!           unchanged.
!
!   Output Argument
!
!   R       R(1) = the sum from I=1 to I=N of R(I)
!
!           If N is even set L = N/2; if N is odd set L = (N+1)/2
!
!             then for K = 2,...,L
!
!                R(2*K-2) = the sum from I = 1 to I = N of
!
!                     R(I)*COS((K-1)*(I-1)*2*PI/N)
!
!                R(2*K-1) = the sum from I = 1 to I = N of
!
!                    -R(I)*SIN((K-1)*(I-1)*2*PI/N)
!
!           If N is even
!
!                R(N) = the sum from I = 1 to I = N of
!
!                     (-1)**(I-1)*R(I)
!
!   Note:  This transform is unnormalized since a call of RFFTF
!          followed by a call of RFFTB will multiply the input
!          sequence by N.
!
!   WSAVE  contains results which must not be destroyed between
!          calls of RFFTF or RFFTB.
