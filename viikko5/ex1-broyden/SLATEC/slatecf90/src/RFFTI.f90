!
!   Subroutine RFFTI initializes the array WSAVE which is used in
!   both RFFTF and RFFTB.  The prime factorization of N together with
!   a tabulation of the trigonometric functions are computed and
!   stored in WSAVE.
!
!   Input Argument
!
!   N       the length of the sequence to be transformed.
!
!   Output Argument
!
!   WSAVE   a work array which must be dimensioned at least 2*N+15.
!           The same work array can be used for both RFFTF and RFFTB
!           as long as N remains unchanged.  Different WSAVE arrays
!           are required for different values of N.  The contents of
!           WSAVE must not be changed between calls of RFFTF or RFFTB.
