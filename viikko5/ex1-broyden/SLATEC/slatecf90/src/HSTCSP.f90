!***DESCRIPTION
!
!     HSTCSP solves the standard five-point finite difference
!     approximation on a staggered grid to the modified Helmholtz
!     equation spherical coordinates assuming axisymmetry (no dependence
!     on longitude).

!
!            (LAMBDA/(R*SIN(THETA))**2)U  =  F(THETA,R)
!
!     where THETA is colatitude and R is the radial coordinate.
!     This two-dimensional modified Helmholtz equation results from
!     the Fourier transform of the three-dimensional Poisson equation.

!
!   INTL
!     = 0  On initial entry to HSTCSP or if any of the arguments
!          C, D, N, or NBDCND are changed from a previous call.
!
!     = 1  If C, D, N, and NBDCND are all unchanged from previous
!          call to HSTCSP.
!
!     NOTE:  A call with INTL = 0 takes approximately 1.5 times as much
!            time as a call with INTL = 1.  Once a call with INTL = 0
!            has been made then subsequent solutions corresponding to
!            different F, BDA, BDB, BDC, and BDD can be obtained
!            faster with INTL = 1 since initialization is not repeated.
!
!   A,B
!     The range of THETA (colatitude), i.e. A  <=  THETA  <=  B.  A
!     must be less than B and A must be non-negative.  A and B are in
!     radians.  A = 0 corresponds to the north pole and B = PI
!     corresponds to the south pole.
!
!                  * * *  IMPORTANT  * * *
!
!     If B is equal to PI, then B must be computed using the statement
!
!     B = PIMACH(DUM)
!
!     This insures that B in the user's program is equal to PI in this
!     program which permits several tests of the input parameters that
!     otherwise would not be possible.
!
!                  * * * * * * * * * * * *
!
!   M
!     The number of grid points in the interval (A,B).  The grid points
!     in the THETA-direction are given by THETA(I) = A + (I-0.5)DTHETA
!     for I=1,2,...,M where DTHETA =(B-A)/M.  M must be greater than 4.
!
!   MBDCND
!     Indicates the type of boundary conditions at THETA = A and
!     THETA = B.
!
!     = 1  If the solution is specified at THETA = A and THETA = B.
!          (See notes 1, 2 below)
!
!     = 2  If the solution is specified at THETA = A and the derivative
!          of the solution with respect to THETA is specified at
!          THETA = B (See notes 1, 2 below).
!
!     = 3  If the derivative of the solution with respect to THETA is
!          specified at THETA = A (See notes 1, 2 below) and THETA = B.
!
!     = 4  If the derivative of the solution with respect to THETA is
!          specified at THETA = A (See notes 1, 2 below) and the
!          solution is specified at THETA = B.
!
!     = 5  If the solution is unspecified at THETA = A = 0 and the
!          solution is specified at THETA = B. (See note 2 below)
!
!     = 6  If the solution is unspecified at THETA = A = 0 and the
!          derivative of the solution with respect to THETA is
!          specified at THETA = B (See note 2 below).
!
!     = 7  If the solution is specified at THETA = A and the
!          solution is unspecified at THETA = B = PI.
!
!     = 8  If the derivative of the solution with respect to
!          THETA is specified at THETA = A (See note 1 below)
!          and the solution is unspecified at THETA = B = PI.
!
!     = 9  If the solution is unspecified at THETA = A = 0 and
!          THETA = B = PI.
!
!     NOTES:  1.  If A = 0, do not use MBDCND = 1,2,3,4,7 or 8,
!                 but instead use MBDCND = 5, 6, or 9.
!
!             2.  if B = PI, do not use MBDCND = 1,2,3,4,5 or 6,
!                 but instead use MBDCND = 7, 8, or 9.
!
!             When A = 0  and/or B = PI the only meaningful boundary
!             condition is dU/dTHETA = 0.  (See D. Greenspan, 'Numerical
!             Analysis of Elliptic Boundary Value Problems,' Harper and
!             Row, 1965, Chapter 5.)
!
!   BDA
!     A one-dimensional array of length N that specifies the boundary
!     values (if any) of the solution at THETA = A.  When
!     MBDCND = 1, 2, or 7,
!
!              BDA(J) = U(A,R(J)) ,              J=1,2,...,N.
!
!     When MBDCND = 3, 4, or 8,
!
!              BDA(J) = (d/dTHETA)U(A,R(J)) ,    J=1,2,...,N.
!
!     When MBDCND has any other value, BDA is a dummy variable.
!
!   BDB
!     A one-dimensional array of length N that specifies the boundary
!     values of the solution at THETA = B.  When MBDCND = 1, 4, or 5,
!
!              BDB(J) = U(B,R(J)) ,              J=1,2,...,N.
!
!     When MBDCND = 2,3, or 6,
!
!              BDB(J) = (d/dTHETA)U(B,R(J)) ,    J=1,2,...,N.
!
!     When MBDCND has any other value, BDB is a dummy variable.
!
!   C,D
!     The range of R , i.e. C  <=  R  <=  D.
!     C must be less than D.  C must be non-negative.
!
!   N
!     The number of unknowns in the interval (C,D).  The unknowns in
!     the R-direction are given by R(J) = C + (J-0.5)DR,
!     J=1,2,...,N, where DR = (D-C)/N.  N must be greater than 4.
!
!   NBDCND
!     Indicates the type of boundary conditions at R = C
!     and R = D.
!
!     = 1  If the solution is specified at R = C and R = D.
!
!     = 2  If the solution is specified at R = C and the derivative
!          of the solution with respect to R is specified at
!          R = D. (See note 1 below)
!
!     = 3  If the derivative of the solution with respect to R is
!          specified at R = C and R = D.
!
!     = 4  If the derivative of the solution with respect to R is
!          specified at R = C and the solution is specified at
!          R = D.
!
!     = 5  If the solution is unspecified at R = C = 0 (See note 2
!          below) and the solution is specified at R = D.
!
!     = 6  If the solution is unspecified at R = C = 0 (See note 2
!          below) and the derivative of the solution with respect to R
!          is specified at R = D.
!
!     NOTE 1:  If C = 0 and MBDCND = 3,6,8 or 9, the system of equations
!              to be solved is singular.  The unique solution is
!              determined by extrapolation to the specification of
!              U(THETA(1),C).  But in these cases the right side of the
!              system will be perturbed by the constant PERTRB.
!
!     NOTE 2:  NBDCND = 5 or 6 cannot be used with MBDCND = 1, 2, 4, 5,
!              or 7 (the former indicates that the solution is
!              unspecified at R = 0; the latter indicates that the
!              solution is specified).  Use instead NBDCND = 1 or 2.
!
!   BDC
!     A one dimensional array of length M that specifies the boundary
!     values of the solution at R = C.   When NBDCND = 1 or 2,
!
!              BDC(I) = U(THETA(I),C) ,              I=1,2,...,M.
!
!     When NBDCND = 3 or 4,
!
!              BDC(I) = (d/dR)U(THETA(I),C),         I=1,2,...,M.
!
!     When NBDCND has any other value, BDC is a dummy variable.
!
!   BDD
!     A one-dimensional array of length M that specifies the boundary
!     values of the solution at R = D.  When NBDCND = 1 or 4,
!
!              BDD(I) = U(THETA(I),D) ,              I=1,2,...,M.
!
!     When NBDCND = 2 or 3,
!
!              BDD(I) = (d/dR)U(THETA(I),D) ,        I=1,2,...,M.
!
!     When NBDCND has any other value, BDD is a dummy variable.
!
!   ELMBDA
!     The constant LAMBDA in the modified Helmholtz equation.  If
!     LAMBDA is greater than 0, a solution may not exist.  However,
!     HSTCSP will attempt to find a solution.
!
!   F
!     A two-dimensional array that specifies the values of the right
!     side of the modified Helmholtz equation.  For I=1,2,...,M and
!     J=1,2,...,N
!
!              F(I,J) = F(THETA(I),R(J)) .
!
!     F must be dimensioned at least M X N.
!
!   IDIMF
!     The row (or first) dimension of the array F as it appears in the
!     program calling HSTCSP.  This parameter is used to specify the
!     variable dimension of F.  IDIMF must be at least M.
!
!   W
!     A one-dimensional array that must be provided by the user for
!     work space.  With K = INT(log2(N))+1 and L = 2**(K+1), W may
!     require up to (K-2)*L+K+MAX(2N,6M)+4(N+M)+5 locations.  The
!     actual number of locations used is computed by HSTCSP and is
!     returned in the location W(1).
!
!
!            * * * * * *   On Output   * * * * * *
!
!   F
!     Contains the solution U(I,J) of the finite difference
!     approximation for the grid point (THETA(I),R(J)) for
!     I=1,2,...,M, J=1,2,...,N.
!
!   PERTRB
!     If a combination of periodic, derivative, or unspecified
!     boundary conditions is specified for a Poisson equation
!     (LAMBDA = 0), a solution may not exist.  PERTRB is a con-
!     stant, calculated and subtracted from F, which ensures
!     that a solution exists.  HSTCSP then computes this
!     solution, which is a least squares solution to the
!     original approximation.  This solution plus any constant is also
!     a solution; hence, the solution is not unique.  The value of
!     PERTRB should be small compared to the right side F.
!     Otherwise, a solution is obtained to an essentially different
!     problem.  This comparison should always be made to insure that
!     a meaningful solution has been obtained.
!
!   IERROR
!     An error flag that indicates invalid input parameters.
!     Except for numbers 0 and 10, a solution is not attempted.
!
!     =  0  No error
!
!     =  1  A  <  0 or B  >  PI
!
!     =  2  A  >=  B
!

!
!     =  4  C  <  0
!
!     =  5  C  >=  D
!
!     =  6  NBDCND  <  1 or NBDCND  >  6
!
!     =  7  N  <  5
!
!     =  8  NBDCND = 5 or 6 and MBDCND = 1, 2, 4, 5, or 7
!
!     =  9  C  >  0 and NBDCND  >=  5
!
!     = 10  ELMBDA  >  0
!
!     = 11  IDIMF  <  M
!
!     = 12  M  <  5
!
!     = 13  A = 0 and MBDCND =1,2,3,4,7 or 8
!
!     = 14  B = PI and MBDCND  <=  6
!
!     = 15  A  >  0 and MBDCND = 5, 6, or 9
!
!     = 16  B  <  PI and MBDCND  >=  7
!
!     = 17  LAMBDA  /=  0 and NBDCND  >=  5
!
!     Since this is the only means of indicating a possibly
!     incorrect call to HSTCSP, the user should test IERROR after
!     the call.
!
!   W
!     W(1) contains the required length of W.  Also  W contains
!     intermediate values that must not be destroyed if HSTCSP
!     will be called again with INTL = 1.
