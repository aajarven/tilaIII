!***DESCRIPTION
!
!  Subroutine SINQI initializes the array WSAVE which is used in
!  both SINQF and SINQB.  The prime factorization of N together with
!  a tabulation of the trigonometric functions are computed and
!  stored in WSAVE.
!
!  Input Parameter
!
!  N       the length of the sequence to be transformed.  The method
!          is most efficient when N is a product of small primes.
!
!  Output Parameter
!
!  WSAVE   a work array which must be dimensioned at least 3*N+15.
!          The same work array can be used for both SINQF and SINQB
!          as long as N remains unchanged.  Different WSAVE arrays
!          are required for different values of N.  The contents of
!          WSAVE must not be changed between calls of SINQF or SINQB.
