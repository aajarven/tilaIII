!
!   Subroutine RFFTB computes the real periodic sequence from its
!   Fourier coefficients (Fourier synthesis).  The transform is defined
!   below at output parameter R.
!
!   Input Arguments
!
!   N       the length of the array R to be transformed.  The method
!           is most efficient when N is a product of small primes.
!           N may change so long as different work arrays are provided.
!
!   R       a real array of length N which contains the sequence
!           to be transformed.
!
!   WSAVE   a work array which must be dimensioned at least 2*N+15
!           in the program that calls RFFTB.  The WSAVE array must be
!           initialized by calling subroutine RFFTI, and a different
!           WSAVE array must be used for each different value of N.
!           This initialization does not have to be repeated so long as
!           remains unchanged.  Thus subsequent transforms can be
!           obtained faster than the first.  Moreover, the same WSAVE
!           array can be used by RFFTF and RFFTB as long as N remains
!           unchanged.
!
!   Output Argument
!
!   R       For N even and for I = 1,...,N
!
!                R(I) = R(1)+(-1)**(I-1)*R(N)
!
!                     plus the sum from K=2 to K=N/2 of
!
!                      2.*R(2*K-2)*COS((K-1)*(I-1)*2*PI/N)
!
!                     -2.*R(2*K-1)*SIN((K-1)*(I-1)*2*PI/N)
!
!           For N odd and for I = 1,...,N
!
!                R(I) = R(1) plus the sum from K=2 to K=(N+1)/2 of
!
!                     2.*R(2*K-2)*COS((K-1)*(I-1)*2*PI/N)
!
!                    -2.*R(2*K-1)*SIN((K-1)*(I-1)*2*PI/N)
!
!   Note:  This transform is unnormalized since a call of RFFTF
!          followed by a call of RFFTB will multiply the input
!          sequence by N.
!
!   WSAVE  contains results which must not be destroyed between
!          calls of RFFTB or RFFTF.
