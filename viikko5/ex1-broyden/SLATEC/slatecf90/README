The F90 version obtained from: 
http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~burkardt/f_src/slatec/slatec.html 

CHANGES
-------

The routine D1MACH changed to use Fortran90 floating point inquiry
functions.

Feb 2017: Corrected a bug: Jacobian was calculated as its
transpose. Both in C anf Fortran versions.

BUILDING THE LIBRARY
--------------------

To create the library go to directory 'src' and give commands

make cleanall
make

This should create file libslatec.a in that directory.
Has been tested using gfortran, ifort, and openf95 compilers. 


USING THE LIBRARY
-----------------

To use the library in your programs use the compilation command like

gfortran -o myprog myprog.f90 -lslatec -L/path/to/library/directory

When using the library in C programs (at least with gcc) you should
compile the program with gfortran:

gfortran -o myprog myprog.c -lslatec -L/path/to/library/directory

(This is because SLATEC built by gfortran uses some fortran libraries
and they are automatically linked when using gfortran to compile the
code. On the other hand, to compile the C code gfortran notices that
the source is in C and processes it using the C front-end.)
